     Returns a new geometry transformed to the srid given. Assumes if
     the initial geom is lacking an SRS that it is the one given by the
     "from_srid" parameter. (Hence the "smartness" of this function.)
     
     This fixes many silent bugs when transforming between SRSes when the
     geometry is missing this info.
